csil_status
===========

reports the status of CSIL machines


What do?
========

We're not sure what we're doing right now aside form gathering analytics.

At the moment, we can successfully remote SSH into more computers than known at CSIL.
To gather this information, run `ant init`.  This will run the initializer that 
populates the database.
